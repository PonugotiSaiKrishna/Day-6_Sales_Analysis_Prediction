# 🚀 Day 6 — Data Analysis, Visualization & Sales Prediction 📊🤖  

This project is part of my **30-Day Data Analysis + AI Challenge**.  
Focus for Day 6: Combining **EDA, Visualization, and Predictive Modeling** to analyze Amazon/Warehouse sales data and build a forecasting model.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Analyze sales data to:  
- Identify drivers of sales performance  
- Visualize patterns & seasonality  
- Build a predictive model to forecast future sales  

---

## 🔹 Dataset & Preparation
- **Source:** Warehouse_and_Retail_Sales.csv  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - Handled missing values (`fillna`)  
  - Encoded categorical variables (`get_dummies`)  
  - Checked data quality (`isnull`, duplicates)  

---

## 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of sales  
- Trend analysis over time  
- Correlation between numerical features  
- Product & category-level performance  
- Region-wise and seasonal patterns  

---

## 🔹 Visual Insights
- Top-performing categories and products  
- Seasonality & trend components in sales  
- Correlation heatmap of drivers  
- Region/category underperformance insights  

---

## 🔹 Predictive Modeling
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression  
- **Tools:** scikit-learn (`train_test_split`, `LinearRegression`)  
- **Metrics Evaluated:** RMSE, MAE, R²  

---

## 📊 Results
- Model captured key sales drivers  
- Detected seasonality & trends  
- Reliable performance on validation data  

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Focus on **high ROI product segments**  
- Optimize **underperforming regions/categories**  
- Use **scenario-based forecasts** for planning  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add external signals (promotions, pricing, channels)  
- Try ensemble/gradient boosting models  
- Automate analysis pipeline  
- Deploy dashboards with scheduled refresh  
- A/B test data-driven decisions  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- PowerPoint for business storytelling
